# From Imposter to Leader: Embracing the Journey

Have you ever felt like a fraud in a professional setting? Raised your hand during a business meeting, only to be gripped by that nagging feeling that you don't belong there? I have. And here's the thing: that feeling isn't a weakness—it's a sign you're pushing your boundaries and challenging yourself.

## A Tale of Two Worlds

Growing up just ten minutes from affluent neighborhoods, I used to drive past beautiful houses and wonder, "Who lives there? What did they do to deserve this kind of success?" Now, ironically, I live in one of those houses. But that journey? That's where imposter syndrome began its whispers.

I was fortunate to have two loving parents, despite our financial limitations. While many of my childhood friends were heading down one path, life had different plans for me. After getting kicked out of public schools, I landed in a private school—my last option, really. That's where everything changed.

My basketball coach became more than just an instructor; he became a mentor who taught me how to be a man. His philosophy was simple but profound: life is 99% what you make of it, 1% what you can't control. No excuses. Just work. For the first time, I started seeing possibilities instead of limitations.

I found myself caught between two worlds. At private school, I was surrounded by kids who had things I'd never imagined. I started fitting in, learning their ways, seeing their opportunities. But back in my old neighborhood? My childhood friends said I was changing, that I wasn't "one of them" anymore. They were right—I was changing. I felt like an impostor in both worlds: not quite fitting in with my new peers, but no longer fitting in with my old ones either.

Basketball became my ticket to college with a full scholarship. But the real game-changer? The Internet and computer programming. I discovered this whole new world of possibilities, fell in love with it, and that became my path forward. Through years of hard work and determination, I built a successful business.

## Understanding Imposter Syndrome

Imposter syndrome isn't actually a syndrome of failure—it's a syndrome of success. You don't feel like an impostor when you're comfortable. You feel like an impostor when you're stretching, growing, achieving things you once thought were beyond your reach.

In the business world, it shows up in predictable but powerful ways:

- When you close a bigger deal than ever before, but worry you oversold
- When your company hits a new milestone, but you attribute it to lucky timing
- When you're surrounded by incredible achievers and question if your success measures up

Research confirms that imposter syndrome is almost universal among high achievers. The higher you climb, the more likely you are to experience it. Why? Because success and growth mean constantly pushing beyond your comfort zone, repeatedly doing things you've never done before.

## Managing Imposter Syndrome: A Two-Pronged Approach

### The Internal Game: Changing Your Mindset

Start by naming it. That feeling of being a fraud? Call it what it is—imposter syndrome. It's like turning on the lights and realizing the monster in the dark is just a shadow.

Next comes the harder part—actively rewiring your thoughts. When that voice in your head says "You don't belong here," counter it with evidence. Keep a "Reality Check List":

- Projects you've successfully led
- Challenges you've overcome
- Lives you've impacted through your work
- Value you've brought to conversations

### The External Game: Building Your Support System

Find your tribe—people who are willing to be real. The power of a strong support network comes from:

**Vulnerability**: Share your challenges, personal struggles, and deep fears. When others do the same, you realize you're not alone.

**Perspective**: When you're in your own head, imposter syndrome can feel like a personal failing. Hearing respected peers talk about their own struggles helps you realize it's a shared human experience.

## A Call to Action

As I write this post , I have two requests:

For those currently experiencing imposter syndrome:

- Meet it head-on
- Embrace the discomfort
- Seek support and connection

For those who have moved past it:

- Be the mentor you needed
- Create safe spaces for vulnerability
- Help others navigate their journey

Remember: Imposter syndrome isn't just about feeling like you don't belong. It's a signal that you're pushing boundaries, taking risks, and growing. And that's exactly what leaders do.
