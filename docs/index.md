# Welcome

I'm the CEO and Founder @ [KORTX](https://www.kortx.io), full stack software and data engineer, angel investor, and startup advisor. I write about my business experiences, technology, and how to systematically improve marketing and advertising.

After years of leading technology and media teams for holding companies and startups, building marketing solutions for some of the world’s largest brands, I launched KORTX—and I’ve never looked back.

I've helped countless brands and agencies meet their marketing objectives through the use of technology. When I'm not working on the business at KORTX, I'm evaluating technology and AI tools to empower our customers. I hope to give back by sharing some of what I've learned throughout my journey with all of you.

# Who Am I Writing For?

This blog is for anyone with an interest in entrepreneurship, technology, or AI—especially those leading small teams or starting out with limited resources. I've made many mistakes along the way and will make more in the future. My content will focused on helping you achieve success with minimal cost and maximum efficiency.

If you're an aspiring entrepreneur seeking actionable insights, a technologist exploring ways to apply your skills in a resource-constrained environment, or an AI enthusiast eager to leverage affordable tools to drive impact, you'll find valuable, practical takeaways here.

Through a mix of lessons from my own journey as a founder and CEO, cost-conscious strategies, and tools that have helped KORTX and other small teams succeed, this blog is designed to inspire and empower you to take your business or project to the next level—without breaking the bank.

# What This is Not
This blog is not a quick-fix manual or a get-rich-quick guide. Entrepreneurship, technology, and AI are complex, nuanced fields that require curiosity, persistence, and a willingness to learn through trial and error. If you're looking for overnight success hacks or one-size-fits-all solutions, this probably isn’t the place for you.

It’s also not a place for abstract, academic discussions that lack practical application. While I occasionally explore high-level ideas, my focus is on actionable insights and strategies that you can apply in the real world—whether you're launching a startup, scaling your business, or exploring new AI tools.

Finally, this isn’t just a tech blog or a marketing playbook—it’s a blend of both, with a heavy emphasis on the intersection of business, technology, and advertising. If you’re here for only one of those aspects, you might find this blog overlaps with areas you didn’t even know you were interested in—and that’s by design.
